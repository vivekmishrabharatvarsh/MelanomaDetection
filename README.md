# Melanoma Detection Using CNN

> This project aims to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. The model will help in reducing manual effort needed for diagnosis by evaluating images and alerting dermatologists about the presence of melanoma.

## General Information
- **Business Problem:** Develop a solution to evaluate skin images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma, reducing manual effort in diagnosis.
- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Conclusions
- Data augmentation was used to address overfitting/underfitting, improving the model's generalization.
- Rectifying class imbalances in the training dataset using the Augmentor library improved the model's performance.

## Technologies Used
- Keras - 2.6.0
- TensorFlow - 2.7.0
- Augmentor - 0.2.8

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need for efficient melanoma detection techniques.
